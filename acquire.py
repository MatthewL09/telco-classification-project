# Wrangle

# Modules (acquire.py + prepare.py)

# Module(s) with user-defined functions for acquiring and preparing the data should be created.

# Each function contains a helpful docstring explaining what it does, its input(s) and output(s).

# Credentials (such as in an env.py file) are NOT included in the public repo.

# For example:

# test acquire function
# add to acquire.py module
# write code to clean data in notebook
# merge code into a single function & test
# write code to split data in notebook
# merge code into a single function & test
# merge functions in a single function & test
# Add all 3 functions (or more) to prepare.py file
# import into notebook and test functions
